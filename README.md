Slides and files for talk at MAA Missouri 2015 Spring Meeting Talk

### Abstract: 

  We will discuss ways of bringing inquiry, problem-solving, questioning, and conjecturing into mathematics courses. 
  Our focus will be on understanding the opportunities we have to get students involved in doing authentic mathematical 
  work at any level, and considering the challenges that we face when doing so.
  Each course and audience needs its own approach, but we will talk about some guiding principles for running an active, 
  student-centered classroom, and some practical techniques that can be tried right away.
